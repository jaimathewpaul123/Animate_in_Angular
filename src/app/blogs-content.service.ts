      "content": "<p>It is well-known that the world is going through the largest internal migration in human history. People from rural areas are moving to the cities and urbanisation is at its peak. In India, there are about 300 million internal migrants who have moved to the urban areas in search of jobs. Most of them come from agricultural families. This exodus also brings into question the viability of farming as a profitable occupation: is there a silver lining that signals the reversal of this brain drain?</p><p>Yes, there is. We are now seeing an increasing number of urban middle-class people with non-farming backgrounds moving to the villages. The demographic is usually in their 20’s and early 30’s, tend to be well-educated and filled with the strong desire to make a difference.<p></p>But what attracts these people to give up their steady paychecks, life in rural areas and pursue a strenuous life? The dissatisfaction of the corporate lifestyle. They choose to pursue agricultural activities because the occupation is not only immensely satisfying but noble for the society too. Additionally, cultivating the land together helps the family to bond. Instead of the husband and wife commuting separately to their respective offices, the whole family can pitch in and contribute to every stage within farming cycle. This is an insurance against the disconnected lifestyle we are seeing these days in the cities.</p><p>It turns out that in the process of following their passion, they also serve as agents of change in the local communities. They serve as a role model on what could be achieved with the existing resources. Let us see a few examples of these youngsters in action.</p><p>Sankalp Sharma, an engineer and an MBA from Madhya Pradesh, initially joined a high-profile banking job like his peers. Later, he realized that his plush corporate job did not bring him happiness despite a good paycheck. So, he returned to his ancestral village to give something back to the society and started farming on a 10 acre plot of land with his father. His academic background gave him a fresh perspective on dealing with common agricultural issues. He went beyond just figuring out ways to increase the productivity of the land: he methodically scrutinized each stage of the farming cycle using his business acumen.</p><p>He started by analyzing the input and output costs and realized that the lack of bargaining power forces  the common farmer to  buy seeds, fertilizers and pesticides at retail prices and sell his produce at wholesale prices. So, he figured out a way to reduce the input costs using a technique called ‘Natural Farming’ that eliminates usage of chemicals. He is also setting up a marketing channel that would allow neighboring farmers to sell the crops at a higher price directly in the cities. This will reduce the significant price difference commonly seen between what the farmer sells and what the urban customer pays. He actively encourages the next generation of rural youngsters to continue their ancestral livelihood.<p></p>Karthikeyan, an MBA graduate from Tamil Nadu gave up a promising corporate career and decided to pursue farming. He researched on precision farming and decided to apply those techniques to his crops. He wanted to bring a fresh perspective and promote usage of appropriate technology to maximize the yield.</p><p>Karthikeyan zoned in on Drip fertigation which involves applying a targeted amount of Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium directly to the root area as a liquid solution. This reduces the overall water requirement and also conserves the soil’s nutrients from getting washed away. His single acre yields 12 lakhs per year and he is enthusiastic about promoting the use of micro irrigation tubes to the rest of the farming community. </p><p>As with any business, for agriculture to remain a viable occupation, farmers need to find customers willing to pay a good price for their products. However, the existing farming community has limited exposure to the current trends in marketing/e-commerce. The introduction of Reliance Jio gives the assurance of internet connectivity, so what is lacking currently is the appropriate guidance on how to use available technologies.  The infusion of savvy urban youngsters with the technical knowhow into the rural communities will allow farmers to utilize the latest techniques for selling their produce. Let us see an example of someone whose passion transformed benefited an entire community.</p><p>Anirudh Prasad from Mumbai finished his Masters degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Manchester and started working for Hindustan Dorr-Oliver. However, the bureaucratic nature of the job frustrated his efforts to contribute effectively. He quit his corporate job and moved to Kolli Hills in Tamil Nadu to help the farming community through technology. He noticed that despite the farming community growing healthy crops such as millets, they were not able to profit significantly from it. He thought deeply on bringing about a long-term and self-sustaining change in their livelihoods. So he ushered in new measures that modernised the post-harvest procedures. </p><p>He identified the health-conscious urban communities as the target market and focussed his efforts to help the rural community to tailor their products to this audience. He organized computer literacy classes to help the farmers understand Accounting principles, Microsoft Word and Excel. With their newfound skills, the farmers were able to reply to customer feedback on their email addresses. This allowed them to rectify the packaging of contents to make it visually appealing. Due to his perseverance, millets from this particular rural community are now available in a number of high-end organic stores in Southern India.</p><p>The above examples highlight how the entry of new-age agriculturists is bringing about a fundamental shift in rural community practices. They are not only following their passion by giving up the uber-cool urban lifestyle but also infusing vibrancy to the rural communities. They bring with them fresh ideas and ways of thinking that helps the rural community to grow and prosper. The new-age farmers are also willing to try new ideas through extensive research. They share  insights with the rest of the community in the hope of a better shared future.<p></p>In the coming years, we will be seeing more and more urban people moving from their well-paid jobs and taking up a career in rural areas. This will allow better investments in farming technologies and usher in a new era where agriculture is seen as a viable career option.</p>",

      "title": "From Farmer To Entrepreneur: The Agripreneur",
      "title_shortened": "",
      "content": "<p>With a record 272 million tons of produce,the total crop output today is higher than at any point in India’s history.  The methods adopted over the years, starting with the Green Revolution, to increase the productivity of the land have yielded various levels of success resulting in food security for the nation. Yet, the state of the farmers is not noticeably better than it was in the previous decades. Can there be an approach that will fundamentally change the status quo and make the farmers better off? </p><p>Yes, by making the farmer to think of himself as an entrepreneur responsible for his success. When a farmer thinks and acts as a businessman, he will dare to take risks. Farmers so far have thought of ways to increase the productivity of their land. When they see themselves as an entrepreneur, their focus will shift towards profitability and building a sustainable enterprise. Currently two-thirds of the farmers have tiny land holdings (less than 2 hectares) and are engaged in subsistence agriculture. Making them aware of a profitable means of utilizing their land would trigger an agricultural revolution that will affect all spheres of the society.</p><p>The pertinent question: How  to trigger the change? </p><p>Can there be an unconventional approach that changes the farmers’ perspective of himself? Yes, we believe so - by inducing the entrepreneurship mindset in them.</p><p>Entrepreneurs look at market opportunities to achieve the highest Return on Investment (ROI). Many parts of the farming cycle can be viewed using the entrepreneur lens. The farmer looks at the current market conditions and decides what to plant for the season. Then he invests either his own capital or borrows money to buy the necessary inputs for planting the crops. This is followed by hiring labourers who help him sow, maintain, and harvest. He carefully monitors what the state of his crops (business) is and makes appropriate adjustments to the dosage of fertilizers, pesticides, etc. Finally he sells his crop at a profit and clears his debt and keeps some money for the next investment cycle. The whole production and selling cycle holds a lot of uncertainty. The vibrant growth and harvest is reward for the risk taken.</p><p>The new breed of farmers, the agripreneur, would view the whole farming cycle in terms of ROI using their land, labor, and time as the inputs. Instead of focussing on how to increase the productivity of a single crop like rice or wheat, the agripreneur looks into ways of increasing his ROI. Agripreneurs with the innovative streak in them are open to experimentation despite constraints in the resources. </p><p>Here are some inspirational narratives of farmers who took the leap. Mr. Sadananda is a farmer from Karnataka with a small land-holding (2 acres). Conventional monocropping would have put him at the same income level as a subsistence farmer. Yet, through multi-cropping and other methods, he increased the yearly income to 22 lakhs. He rotates between 30 crops based on the market conditions aiming for the highest ROI. He even raises dogs, poultry and fish to supplement the income. Like a true agripreneur, he experiments scientifically with ways to reduce the input costs by trying out methods such as recycling the previous year’s waste products, drip irrigation, etc. Additionally, he realizes the importance of marketing his products and is savvy enough to find ways to sell both crops and animals.</p><p>The other aspect of thinking like an entrepreneur involves sustainable practices: What techniques can be adopted now to sacrifice short-term gains for long-term profits? Let us look at another agripreneurial effort that illustrates this approach.</p><p>Mr. Narayana Reddy lives around Bengaluru’s outskirts. Despite getting high yields through chemical fertilizers, he knew that this practice was ecologically and economically unsustainable. Mr. Reddy made a strategic move to give up fertilizers and instead followed organic methods. </p><p>He persevered through a few years of mediocre outputs because the fertilizers in the previous years had inadvertently killed off the natural organisms in the soil. Soon, the land rejuvenated itself and he produced consistent bumper profits from crops. Due to his sustainable practices, the fertility of the land is preserved for future generations. </p><p>To promote the sustainable and profitable ideology,  a fundamental shift in the farming community practices would be required on a large scale. To replicate these successes nation-wide, what measures are being taken and by whom? </p><p>This pursuit of social change is being taken up by many non-profit organizations and some corporates.The World Bank has recently sponsored the Vrutti scheme aimed at changing the livelihoods of the marginalized small tribal farmers in Chattisgarh. Vrutti aims to impact at all stages of the farming cycle including building a business plan, reducing inputs, federating many farmers to increase selling power, training them on management, governance processes, and marketing the produce. They have an ambitious target of increasing the farming income 10-fold over a 5-year period.<p></p>Mahindra has launched schemes to train the farmers to be self-reliant and think like an entrepreneur. They plan to reach 2 million farmers by 2020 and positively impact their lifestyle through collaborations with the Department of Agriculture, NGO’s and Academic institutions. The entry of the corporate sector provides the much-needed guidance and best-practices from the industry.</p><p>If more large corporations were to adopt similar socially-responsible missions, this would give a high-enough visibility to this cause and encourage the Government to contribute their might in reaching all 140 million Indian farmers. The agripreunership attitude is crucial to helping the farmer to unleash his true potential and propel India’s farming community to be among the most advanced in the world.</p>",
